| Jan 24 |    class    |                                                                                                                              In class we talked about how to solve this recursively: basically using the largest number of coins in the problem in all ways possible, then recursing with that largest coin value removed. |
| Jan 26 |   9-9:30    |                       I was thinking about the "base case" or the smallest verison of the problem that we could build off of. I think we could sort the coins from least to greatest and then solve the problem with the smallest number first and find a way to use that information with the bigger numbers that follow. |
| Jan 29 | 10:15-10:45 | I talked to a couple people who were in class to see what they were thinking/talking about, which was kind of similar to what I was thinking. They also brought up the idea of making the problem smaller both in terms of the number of coins and the value of the coins -- i'm not sure how to do both at the same time. |
| Feb 2  |  4:30-5:15  |                                                                                                                                                              I went over the slides a bit and decided to use tabulation bc that approach made the most sense to me. I started coding a bit: set up my variables and loops. |
| Feb 3  | 9:45-10:20  |                                                                                                                           Printed out table values and found one bug: I was changing the 0 column representing the fact that we've successfully made the number (so I was over-counting). But I'm still missing something. |
