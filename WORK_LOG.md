| Jan 24 | class  |                                                                                                        In class we talked about how to solve this recursively: basically using the largest number of coins in the problem in all ways possible, then recursing with that largest coin value removed. |
| Jan 26 | 9-9:30 | I was thinking about the "base case" or the smallest verison of the problem that we could build off of. I think we could sort the coins from least to greatest and then solve the problem with the smallest number first and find a way to use that information with the bigger numbers that follow. |
